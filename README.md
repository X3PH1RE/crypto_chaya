### Project Description
"Locked in Time" is a unique web-based escape room with coding quests that challenge users' skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each room contains puzzles like removing obstructive elements, disabling tricky event listeners, or fixing reversed inputs—all designed to make users debug and manipulate code to progress. This project blends a fun, interactive UI with coding challenges, immersing users in an engaging, skill-sharpening experience.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Escaping a web page that seems determined to keep you trapped. With buttons that dodge clicks, hidden blockers, and fields that type backwards, each room is a new, absurd challenge. It’s all about the fun of outsmarting these silly, overcomplicated obstacles to break free!

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Our project is a digital escape room where every level traps you with quirky, browser-based coding puzzles. The goal is simple—click a button to escape—but each button is blocked by bizarre, code-driven obstacles like invisible barriers, runaway buttons, reverse typing, and infinite loading loops. To break free, players must inspect, debug, and outsmart the page’s code using developer tools and JavaScript know-how. It’s a fun, hands-on way to apply coding skills while navigating through increasingly absurd challenges!
